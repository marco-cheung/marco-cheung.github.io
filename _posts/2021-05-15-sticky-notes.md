## Introduction

[Sticky
Notes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-sticky-notes-86b36182-fdf5-4f9b-af7a-2846f83263f5)
is an app from Microsoft that I use quite often for jotting down
useful ideas that popped into my head, or simply as a place to
temporarily store some text. I differentiate sticky notes and To-Do's
by their importance &mdash; To-Do's are things I have to finish by a
specific deadline whether I want to or not.

Ideas often strike when I'm taking public transportation. That's why I
mostly create new sticky notes on my phone. When I get home and sit
before the laptop ready to work, I can put my phone aside and view the
same notes that I took during the day on my laptop. The syncing
feature also allows easy copy-and-pasting across different platforms.

## Sticky Notes on different platforms.

On **Windows 10**, Sticky Notes is a standalone application that is
most likely preinstalled. If it isn't (or if you deleted it), you can
still download it free [from the Microsoft
Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-sticky-notes/9nblggh4qghw?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

On both **Android** and **iOS**, Sticky Notes is integrated as a part of
OneNote. Therefore, you would have to download OneNote on your mobile
phone even if you just want to use the Sticky Notes feature.

On **macOS**, the only way to access Sticky Notes is through a web browser (this approach will work on any other platform as well). Sticky Notes in the web is integrated as part of the Outlook web email interface. Sign into your Microsoft account and head over to [outlook.live.com/mail/0/notes](https://outlook.live.com/mail/0/notes) to enjoy the sync.

## Concluding words

If you are in search of an app for storing random thoughts and sudden
inspirations, try out Sticky Notes! If you're already using Sticky
Notes but didn't know about the syncing feature, I'm glad my post
helped!

Either way, that's all for this time. Cheers.
