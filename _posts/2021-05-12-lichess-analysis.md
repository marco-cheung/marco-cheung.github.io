## Foreword

> Note: This post is showing you how to analyze your chess games
> "after" the game is over, with the intention of
> self-improvement. Please do not use this knowledge to analyze an
> on-going game, as this is considered cheating and is something a
> self-respecting chess player would never do.

One of the best ways to improve in chess is to at least run through a
basic analysis after a game and learn from your own mistakes and your
opponent's. With the "Analysis" feature on
[Chess.com](https://chess.com), you can see the best move at each
turn, as well as a live computer evaluation of who is in a more
advantageous position in a given time (positive for White, negative
for Black).

However, free accounts on Chess.com only have limited access to the
"Analysis" tab, and if you play as often as I do, you'll soon be
blocked by a pop-up that asks you to upgrade to a premium
membership. Many friends of mine have testified that the premium
membership on Chess.com is well worth the price (especially the
lessons), but if you're not willing to pay just for the game analysis
feature, I've got good news for you.

## Enter Lichess

[Lichess](https://lichess.org) is an open-source featured-packed chess
website, and the second most popular chess platform right after
Chess.com. The UI may be a bit primitive and counter-intuitive in
comparison to Chess.com at first, but you'll soon get used to it.


##### Open up the Analysis board on Lichess

On the Lichess website, head over to the "Tools" tab on top, and click
on "Analysis board" in the drop-down. Notice the PGN text box below
the chessboard: this is where we will import the games we played on
Chess.com for free analysis here on Lichess. PGN stands for Portable
Game Notation, and according to Wikipedia, is a "standard plain text
format for recording chess games (both the moves and related data),
which can be read by humans and is also supported by most chess
software."

##### Find a game you'd like to import

Moving on to the next step, go back to Chess.com to find a game you'd
like to analyze (completed games can be found under your
profile). Click on "Analysis". (If no pop-up shows and you still have
the quota to analyze your game, you might as well stop this tutorial
and just analyze the game on Chess.com.) Find the "download" icon
somewhere on the bottom right of the page. Copy the whole PGN section,
go back to Lichess' Analysis board, and paste the values in Lichess'
PGN text box. If you see 2 checkboxes above the PGN section in
Chess.com, be sure to check the one in a human form.

##### Start analyzing

In Lichess, the final step is to click on the "Toggle local evaluation
switch" on the top right corner (or press keyboard shortcut "lowercase
L") &mdash; and voila! You can now browse through each step with the
left and right arrow and see what the engine suggests at each
move. You can even adjust the evaluation "depth" if you are feeling
adventurous.

## Concluding words

Of course, you could always just play on Lichess and directly analyze
the game after it's over. However, as much as I respect and support
Lichess' open-sourceness, I find the UI/UX, cheating detection, and
overall player quality on Chess.com better. That's why I mostly play
on Chess.com and only turn to Lichess for analyzing games, studying
opening repertoires, or creating personal chess notes.
