I have a few long-time hobbies, and one of them is fragrances. It's
not a common one, which is one of the reasons I take pride in
developing a unique preference and insight into this relatively niche
industry. "Scent" is a damn subjective category. What some people find
pleasant, could very well be harshly hated by others. I enjoy hitting
fragrance stores and trying out different smells in my free time. Over
the years, I have tried out *possibly over a hundred* different
fragrances and developed a sharper sense in identifying typical notes
such as citrus, bergamot, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper, leather, tobacco,
and oud, to name a few. Obviously, on various occasions I might
misidentify the scent notes, but overall I'd like to believe myself to
be a semi-expert when it comes to perfume and cologne designs.

This post serves as an introduction to my upcoming series of short
articles on the fragrances that I own. Despite being such in love with
fragrances, I try not to go crazy and become an "injudicious fragrance
collector", and would only purchase a scent when I'm "really feeling
it". To date, I own and have owned around 10 different fragrances,
which include (subject to change):

- Boss Bottled (aka No. 6) by *Hugo Boss*
- Mercedes Benz Intense by *Mercedes Benz*
- English Oak & Hazelnut by *Jo Malone*
- Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Homme EDP by *Gucci*
- Jimmy Choo Man EDT by *Jimmy Choo*
- CK Be by *Calvin Klein*
- Black by *Ferrari*
- Voyage by *Armaf*
- Sauvage by *Dior*
- Coach For Men by *Coach*

Each fragrance will have its own review as an individual post. I will
not on any account persuade the reader to buy a certain fragrance or
assert what's "best" for you. I also promise to give my wholehearted
opinions towards these scents, regardless of brand and price. Lastly,
I am in no way associated with any of these brands &mdash; so rest
assured, there will be no sponsors influencing my choice of
words. Every fragrance that I write about is either purchased by me or
given to me as a gift by family.

That's all for today, I'm really looking forward to putting out the
reviews in the coming weeks.
