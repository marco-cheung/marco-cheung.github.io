In my [previous post](../system-default-monospace-fonts-pt1), I talked about the practical reasons to use
monospace fonts and introduced four system default fonts: Consolas, SF
Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono, and Roboto Mono.

Here's to refresh the memory:

| Operating system | Default monospace font |
| -----------      | -----------            |
| Windows 10       | Consolas               |
| macOS            | SF Mono                |
| Linux            | DejaVu Sans Mono       |
| Android          | Roboto Mono            |


In addition to these four system fonts, I also mentioned Menlo and
Monaco as deprecated default macOS fonts. In this blog post, I will
give a subjective comparison of these 6 typefaces, as well as
their respective historical backgrounds. Buckle up and sit tight!

## Consolas

_Consolas_

First on the list is Microsoft's Consolas, which happens to be my
all-time favorite monospace font. For practical use, I love the
thicker characters that enhance readability at smaller sizes, and the
generally narrower body to allow more columns to be shown in my code
editor. The details in the low-hanging "r", slightly triangular angles
of "M", the slanting vertical line of the dollar symbol, and the
elongated comma are in my opinion, what makes this font elegantly
timeless. In general, I also prefer the look of a [looptail
double-storey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G#Typographic_variants)
"g", instead of an opentail single-storey one, which is found on SF
Mono, Menlo, DejaVu, Roboto Mono, etc. On top of that, Consolas is
also classified as a
"[humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Humanist)" font
(my favorite category), as opposed to being
[neo-grosteque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Neo-grotesque)
such as the other fonts on the list.

However, nothing is perfect, and there are two things that bug me
about Consolas. First, the italic version of lowercase "k". Cool as
it may be, the cursive loop on top makes the character somewhat stand out
unnecessarily every time I glance through a codebase.

_Consolas' italic k can be distracting at times_

The other problem I have might be due to the
[ClearType](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType) technology behind
the font. Consolas changes the body weight from its regular thickness
to a lighter version (despite it not "actually" having a light
font-weight option) when the font size is smaller than a certain
threshold. On some screen resolutions, that threshold is somewhere
around 9 pt. The behavior is kind of hard to describe, but if you
manually zoom in and out of the display font size (not from a
screenshot, of course), you might pick up what I am talking about.

## SF Mono

![SF Mono Preview](/images/SF-Mono.png){: width="200"}
_SF Mono_

Introduced in 2016, SF Mono is part of Apple's San Francisco font
family. Its license prohibits usage beyond default Apple applications
like Terminal and Xcode. This means that third-party code editors,
such as Sublime Text or Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, will have to
fall back to the previous default macOS font, Menlo. If you really
like SF Mono, there are still ways that you could use it anywhere you
want (the morality of proprietary font usage is controversial, but
there are a few tutorials online that teach you how to do it. Spoiler
alert, it's not hard at all).

In terms of the design, I find SF Mono more
[geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Geometric) than
[neo-grosteque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Neo-grotesque),
especially with the perfectly round curves of 5, 6, and 9. The long
serifs of 'i', 'j', 'l', and 'r' contribute greatly to the overall
neat, well-ordered, and rigid feel of the typeface. However, the
trade-off of tidiness would be the less relaxing vibe that SF Mono
gives off. This is why every time I come back to it, I psychologically
feel more uptight and as a result, get tired more easily. Regarding
readability, Apple has nailed it here &mdash; I can recognize
characters with ease even at much lower font sizes.

## Menlo

> A decade ago, Menlo replaced Monaco as the default monospace font on
> macOS. After a couple of years, Menlo was replaced by SF Mono.

_Menlo_

To understand the design of Apple's Menlo, we must first talk about
Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, perhaps the most influential monospace font
in recent typography. The later popular DejaVu Sans Mono, for example,
is based on Vera, with modifications to certain letters, and a greater
coverage of Unicode characters.

Apple's Menlo, the default system font from Snow Leopard to El
Capitan, is in turn based on DejaVu with little modification. In fact,
in the following picture you can see that Apple's Menlo barely changed
anything from DejaVu Sans Mono, except for the lower position of the
asterisk, the enlargement of quotes and periods, and changing a dotted
zero to a slashed zero. The differences are highlighted in red for
DejaVu and cyan for Menlo.

## DejaVu Sans Mono

_DejaVu Sans Mono_

Having discussed Menlo, there's little left to say about DejaVu. I
have never really liked this font because I find the dashes (minus
symbol) too short and the dots and commas too small &mdash; two things
that Menlo fixed. In addition, the font renders suboptimally on the
Windows 10 operating system regardless of screen resolution. However,
there is no denying that DejaVu Sans Mono is a highly practical font
with a massive collection of Unicode characters, and its derivatives,
Menlo and Hack just to name two, are tremendously popular among
developers.

## Roboto Mono

_Roboto Mono_

Roboto Mono is developed by Google as part of the Roboto family, which
is a constantly evolving typeface that is widely used in Android
devices and websites for its superior readability. Its non-monospace
sans serif version, Roboto, is currently the [most popular font on
Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?sort=popularity).

Roboto Mono, along with DejaVu Sans Mono, is sadly at the bottom of my
preference list. For the record, I never really enjoyed its cousin,
the popular Roboto, either, but that's for some other time. I cannot
enjoy Roboto Mono as much because I feel that it lacks
personality. More abstractly, it tries to be a "safe monospace" font
that stays out of the way and isn't ambitious at all to develop its
own identity.

However, this is just my opinion. It doesn't affect the fact
that Roboto Mono is beloved by many developers, especially if they
want to convey a "modern" touch to their projects. Examples in the
Emacs community include the [lsp-mode
documentation](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/) (notice the font
used in the code blocks) and the
[elegant-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs) project.

Structurally and stylistically I find this font comparable to SF
Mono's uptight neatness, albeit an inferior version of the latter. The
upside is that the entire Roboto family has a highly liberal license,
and is free to use however you like.

## Monaco

![Monaco Preview](/images/Monaco.png){: width="200"}
_Monaco_

Finally, we have Monaco &mdash; and man is this font
adorable! Monaco is my favorite Apple font, and I use it a lot
(alternately with Consolas) back in my MacBook days. When I switched
over to Windows 10 and WSL2, one of the first things I did was try to
install the Monaco TTF file on my machine. Sadly, the font isn't meant
for operating systems other than macOS, so although it technically
shows up rather correctly, you could always tell that some tiny
details in the font's proportions are a bit off.

It's almost impossible "not" to identify this font &mdash; Monaco
gives off such a bald character with its angled ovals in "a", "g",
"q", zigzagging "i" and "l", and perhaps most noticeably in code, the
exaggeratedly curvy parentheses. In fact, if you put an opening and
closing parenthesis next to each other, they'd almost form a
circle. Similarly, if you have an empty pair of square brackets,
they'd almost form a square. Lastly, Monaco is somewhat narrower than
other popular monospace fonts, so with the same font size, you could
fit more horizontal content on the screen.

There is one downside to using Monaco, though. Because of its overly
curvy appearance, it's sometimes hard to align the code visually
despite it being a monospace font. Metaphorically, it's like the
parentheses are fighting to leave the places they are positioned at,
and each character is ballooned to invade the space of others.

## Concluding words

That's all for this journey of exploring system default monospace
fonts! Hope you enjoyed reading it and perhaps learned something new.
