## Why monospace fonts

If you program at all, you've probably noticed that no matter which
code editor you use, the default editor font will always be a
monospace font. This class of fonts enhances readability for programming
because it visually aligns each character with equal
spacing. (However, monospace fonts are not suitable for general text
reading, as we are actually trained to read and recognize words faster
by taking advantage of the differences in character width.)

## System defaults

Here are the system default monospace fonts on Windows 10, macOS,
Google Android, and most Linux distributions.


| Operating system | Default monospace font |
| -----------      | -----------            |
| Windows 10       | Consolas               |
| macOS            | SF Mono                |
| Linux            | DejaVu Sans Mono       |
| Android          | Roboto Mono            |

System default fonts can change over time, and to some degree reflect
the aesthetics of a generation's typography. For instance, Microsoft's
Consolas is designed in the 2000s as a replacement for the
(way-too-old-school-looking) Courier New. Apple on the other hand has
changed their system default monospace fonts first from Monaco to
Menlo in 2009 (Snow Leopard), and then from Menlo to SF Mono in 2018
(El Capitan).

Perhaps the Linux community has been the most consistent in this
regard, using DejaVu Sans Mono at least as a safe default fallback on
most distributions that I know of. However, individual distros may
ship their own fonts to better integrate with the rest of the
system. For instance, the default monospace font on Ubuntu is
Canonical's own Ubuntu Mono.

## The importance of system default monospace fonts

The default monospace font not only lives in code editors and
terminals, but also quite prevalently in modern browsers. Many
websites, such as StackOverflow and GitHub, use CSS rules to target
the font family to show in code blocks. A simple example would be:


```css
font-family: Menlo, Consolas, "Ubuntu Mono",
             "Roboto Mono", "DejaVu Sans Mono",
             monospace;
```


A [more specific
example](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364048/we-are-switching-to-system-fonts-on-may-10-2021)
would be how the entire Stack Exchange family (which includes
StackOverflow) defines its monospace options:

```scss
@ff-mono:
    ui-monospace,
    "Cascadia Mono", "Segoe UI Mono",
    "Ubuntu Mono",
    "Roboto Mono",
    Menlo, Monaco, Consolas,
    monospace;
```

Here, `ui-monospace` targets SF Mono on macOS and iOS devices, and the
last entry `monospace` is the final fallback font on each system
([Reference](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/364048/we-are-switching-to-system-fonts-on-may-10-2021)).
