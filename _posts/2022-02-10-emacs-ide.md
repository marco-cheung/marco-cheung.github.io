## Background

When compared with modern editors and IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA,
PyCharm, and Visual Studio Code), old-school editors like Emacs or Vim
fail to provide intelligent actions such as "auto-complete
(Intellisense)", "go to definition/references", and "on-the-fly error
checking" **out-of-the-box**. After all, this requires a deep
understanding of both the programming language and the code, which is
the main reason why IDEs are created in the first place.

## Language Server Protocol (LSP)

That said, everything changed when Microsoft released its development
of the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). In
short, LSP decouples the tooling into servers and clients, with the
former powering all the intelligent activities, and the latter being
integrated into any development tool of your choice. If you'd like to
read more about the inner workings, consider [this
post](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overviews/lsp/overview/).

auto-completion UI._

All of a sudden, as long as you have a client in your editor that can
communicate with the language servers, which are separately
downloaded, any tool can become as intelligent and feature-rich as the
popular IDEs and smart editors. In other words, if my "primitive"
editor has a thin layer of a client that can communicate with, say,
the Java language server of the Eclipse IDE, my editor can obtain all
the smart features that are exposed by the server and instantly be on
par with Eclipse. Similarly, if I install the same language server
that powers the sweet code actions for TypeScript/JavaScript in VSCode
and hooks it to my editor's client, I wouldn't lose anything by not
using VSCode.

## Clients for LSP

In the Vim/Neovim world, the main players are
[CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and the [native LSP
client](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) of Neovim. In the
Emacs community, the equivalent would be
[lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) and
[eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot). As an Emacs user, I have
tried out both lsp-mode and eglot, and found the former more
configurable, feature-rich, and easy to wrap my head about. In the
rest of this post, I will be using lsp-mode as my client to
demonstrate the configurations of making Emacs an intelligent editor.

To install lsp-mode from MELPA for Emacs, you can use the following
use-package declaration. If you need help setting up use-package, I
also [wrote a post](../setting-up-use-package) on this topic.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :hook ((X-mode Y-mode Z-mode) . lsp-deferred) ; XYZ are to be replaced by python, c++, etc.
  :commands lsp)
```

If we want to enable LSP for C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, we
would write:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :hook ((c++-mode python-mode java-mode js-mode) . lsp-deferred)
  :commands lsp)
```

To enable extra information on the sideline (fixes, suggestions,
documentation), lsp-mode has an extra companion package called
lsp-ui. To enable it, simply do:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-ui
  :commands lsp-ui-mode)
```

I've tweaked some settings to enable features that are not
set by default, and disabled those that I don't find helpful:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-ui
  :commands lsp-ui-mode
  :config
  (setq lsp-ui-doc-enable nil)
  (setq lsp-ui-doc-header t)
  (setq lsp-ui-doc-include-signature t)
  (setq lsp-ui-doc-border (face-foreground 'default))
  (setq lsp-ui-sideline-show-code-actions t)
  (setq lsp-ui-sideline-delay 0.05))
```

## Servers for LSP

Now that we have the client installed and initialized, we need to
provide Emacs with the respective language servers so lsp-mode can
pick up the channels of communication. We'll continue to use C++,
Python, Java, and JavaScript as examples since they seem to be the
most popular languages.

### Setting up C++ 

By default, lsp-mode will look for the "clangd" executable on the
path. "Clangd" is a language server developed by LLVM (which also
develops the clang compilers) and can be downloaded with `brew install
llvm` on macOS, or `pacman -S clang` on Arch.

Clangd is my choice of language server for both C and C++. If for some
reason you don't like LLVM's implementation, you can try out
[ccls](https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls), an alternative language
server for C/C++/ObjC. For lsp-mode to prioritize ccls over clangd,
you need to install and set up [this extra
client](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/emacs-ccls) that leverages
lsp-mode.

### Setting up Python

LSP-mode supports 5 different Python language servers, namely [Spyder
IDE's
python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server),
the [Jedi language
server](https://github.com/pappasam/jedi-language-server), [Palantir's
pyls](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server),
[Microsoft's Pyright language
server](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), and [Microsoft's Python
language server](https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server).

Pyright is my choice of language server for Python. I've heard good
things about Sypder IDE's server but I have yet to try it.

You can install pyright globally with `pip`, `npm`, or your system's
package manager. For instance, `pacman -S pyright`.

We will need a thin layer of extra client,
[lsp-pyright](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-pyright/), to sit atop
lsp-mode and leverage pyright's features. The following is the snippet
to automatically download the client and set it up. Note that I am
using the command `python3` as the executable command, in case both
Python 2 and 3 are installed on the system.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-pyright
  :hook (python-mode . (lambda () (require 'lsp-pyright)))
  :init (when (executable-find "python3")
          (setq lsp-pyright-python-executable-cmd "python3")))
```

### Setting up Java

The go-to language server for Java is [Eclipse's JDT Language
Server](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls). We need
yet another thin layer of a client called
[lsp-java](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-java/) to help leverage
lsp-mode and the JDT server. The good news is once you have lsp-java
installed in Emacs through use-package, the client will "automatically
detect whether the server is missing and download Eclipse JDT Language
Server before the first startup"!

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-java
  :after lsp)
```

### Setting up JavaScript

Finally, let's set up JavaScript for development in Emacs. The
recommended language server for JavaScript (and TypeScript) is the
conveniently-named
[typescript-language-server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server)
(or ts-ls for short), which is a wrapper around Visual Studio Code's
tsserver.

Since lsp-mode has ts-ls support integrated by default, there's no
need to install an additional thin layer of client on top of
lsp-mode. However, we do need to install the language server on our
system. We can install it globally with `npm`:

```
npm install -g typescript-language-server
```

## Extra Configuration for lsp-mode (Optional)

In my opinion, lsp-mode aggressively enables too many features by
default, which may result in visual clutter and a slow-down in
performance. The following is some of my extra configuration for the
lsp-mode client. Whenever you see a pattern of `(setq ... nil)`, it
means I'm disabling that feature. Towards the bottom of the list, I am
also bumping up the chunk-processing threshold to allow for a
smoother Emacs experience.

```emacs-lisp
(use-package lsp-mode
  :hook ((c-mode          ; clangd
          c++-mode        ; clangd
          c-or-c++-mode   ; clangd
          java-mode       ; eclipse-jdtls
          js-mode         ; ts-ls (tsserver wrapper)
          js-jsx-mode     ; ts-ls (tsserver wrapper)
          typescript-mode ; ts-ls (tsserver wrapper)
          python-mode     ; pyright
          web-mode        ; ts-ls/HTML/CSS
          haskell-mode    ; haskell-language-server
          ) . lsp-deferred)
  :commands lsp
  :config
  (setq lsp-auto-guess-root t)
  (setq lsp-log-io nil)
  (setq lsp-restart 'auto-restart)
  (setq lsp-enable-symbol-highlighting nil)
  (setq lsp-enable-on-type-formatting nil)
  (setq lsp-signature-auto-activate nil)
  (setq lsp-signature-render-documentation nil)
  (setq lsp-eldoc-hook nil)
  (setq lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil)
  (setq lsp-modeline-diagnostics-enable nil)
  (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil)
  (setq lsp-semantic-tokens-enable nil)
  (setq lsp-enable-folding nil)
  (setq lsp-enable-imenu nil)
  (setq lsp-enable-snippet nil)
  (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1MB
  (setq lsp-idle-delay 0.5))
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this post gives you a good head-start in making Emacs a
modern and intelligent IDE. I enjoy the experience of fine-tuning my
development environment, even down to hand-picking my own back-end for
editor behaviors. I find it extremely satisfying to be putting these
pieces together and eventually see them work, as if I'm developing a
unique editor configuration that is different from any tool other people
use. Of course, this "hobby" isn't for everybody and if you prefer an
out-of-the-box experience to be able to jump straight into the work,
then feel free to use any IDE that suits your liking.

Either way, I'm glad you stumbled upon my post. That's all for today,
cheers!
