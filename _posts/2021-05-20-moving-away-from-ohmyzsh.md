I started using zsh around 4 years ago when macOS was still using bash
as the default shell just like most Linux distributions. The reason I
made the switch from bash to zsh was that Linux YouTubers like [Luke
Smith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) and
[DistroTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg)
were popularizing and advocating it. Another shell in question was
fish. But after trying out both zsh and fish, I felt like the former
had a greater following and community support. For that reason, I
decided to use zsh as my default shell.

Like most new zsh users, the first thing I did after installing zsh
was installing [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and
followed the README to choose a cool theme for my prompt (there are
more than 140 of them!). For those who have never heard of it,
oh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework and plugin manager that can
allow zsh users to extend their shell functionality and appearances
with significant ease.

Technically, using the term
"[plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins)" is a bit
of a stretch. Every zsh "plugin", for instance, "autojump", or
"colored-man-pages", is just a small shell script, that can be
"plugged into" your `.zshrc` configuration when loading up your zsh.

## So, why move away?

The short answer is "bloat". I find myself using oh-my-zsh only for
prompt themes, colored man pages, fzf, and git integration. Yet there
are 286 plugins in total, waiting for me to enable them. Do I really
need them installed on my machine? It's also not uncommon to think
that "I might as well enable these plugins now that they're installed
anyways" and bit by bit the load time of launching a shell grows.

## What are my essentials?

So last week, I sat down before my `.zshrc` config file and inspected
it. I had made a list of the essentials I need, and if by the end of
my small research, I can do without oh-my-zsh, then I'd uninstall it.

The essential list was:

- A nice prompt.
- No duplicate history when reverse-searching my commands.
- Case insensitive completion.
- Emacs-style keybindings in zsh's command line editor (the place
  where you type out the commands).
- Zsh syntax highlighting.

In the process of listing my essentials, I eliminated "git
integration" from my command line, since 99% of the time I deal with
git stuff in Emacs using the "Magit" package anyways. I have developed
a rather sophisticated workflow in
[Magit](https://emacsair.me/2017/09/01/magit-walk-through/) that
allows me to stage, commit, push, pull, stash, rebase, reword, and
squash, etc. Showing the git status in my shell prompt is cool, but
not essential.

## Uninstalling oh-my-zsh and plugging in my essentials

With a clear goal in mind, I [uninstalled
oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#uninstalling-oh-my-zsh). The
next step is to put back the five essentials listed above into my
`.zshrc` file.

### Goal 1: A nice prompt

This one is easy &mdash; I just need my prompt to be shortened and
easy to notice. With the simple script `PROMPT='ianpan@arch:%1~/ %# '`
placed somewhere in `.zshrc`, I can make my shell prompt look like
this:

![Zsh prompt 1](/images/zsh-prompt1.png){: width="80%"}
_PROMPT='ianpan@arch:%1~/ %# '_

There's just one problem left to address: the prompt can easily be
buried with a load of command line output, and scrolling back to find
which prompt started the command could be hard. For this reason, I
added a gradient "bling" to my prompt by using the 256-color-codes of
shades of blue and cyan.

I modified my simple script to
`PROMPT='%F{33}i%f%F{39}a%f%F{38}n%f%F{44}pan%f%F{50}@%f%F{43}ar%f%F{44}ch%f%F{38}:%1~/%f
%F{44}%#%f '` and my prompt got a 10X upgrade.

_Manually added gradient color codes for my prompt_


I did the same thing for my Ubuntu prompt, except this time with
different text and colors.

`PROMPT='%F{202}i%f%F{208}a%f%F{214}npa%f%F{220}n%F{221}@%f%F{220}ub%f%F{214}un%f%F{208}tu:%f%F{202}%1~/%f %F{214}%#%f '`

_Similar process, except different text and colors for Ubuntu_

### Goal 2: No duplicate history when reverse-searching my commands

This one is pretty simple, too. I added the following lines in my
`.zshrc` and it solved the problem of having duplicate command history
when you press the up-arrow or Ctrl-r to search for commands. These
are just built-in zsh parameters for us to tune. Anywhere you see the
term `hist`, it means "history".

```sh
HISTSIZE=5000
HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history
SAVEHIST=5000
HISTDUP=erase
setopt appendhistory
setopt sharehistory
setopt incappendhistory
setopt hist_ignore_all_dups
setopt hist_save_no_dups
setopt hist_ignore_dups
setopt hist_find_no_dups
```

### Goal 3: Case insensitive completion

I followed [this
guide](https://superuser.com/questions/1092033/how-can-i-make-zsh-tab-completion-fix-capitalization-errors-for-directories-and)
to achieve case insensitive completion, which is the behavior of your
shell correcting your lowercase to uppercase or vice versa, when you
use `TAB` to autocomplete a file or directory name.

TL;DR: just put these two lines somewhere in your
`.zshrc` and you're done:

```sh
autoload -U compinit && compinit
zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list 'm:{a-z}={A-Za-z}'
```

### Goal 4: Emacs-style keybindings

Having used Emacs for 3-4 years now, I know my way around the
Emacs-style keybindings. Here are a couple of them that I find
especially useful.

- Ctrl-a: jump to line beginning (same as pressing `Home`).
- Ctrl-e: jump to line end (same as pressing `End`).
- Alt-backspace: backspaces a whole word.
- Ctrl-k: delete from current position to end-of-line.
- Ctrl-a Ctrl-k: delete whole line (it's a combination of "jump to
  line beginning" and "delete from current position to end-of-line")
- Alt-b: jump left a whole word
- Alt-f: jump right a whole word

Many shells (e.g. bash) already use Emacs-style keybindings by
default. If you still want to explicitly set it, here's how:

```sh
bindkey -e
```

If you're a die-hard vim fan, feel free to set `bindkey -v` to enjoy
vim bindings in your shell's command line editor.

To read more about command line editors, consider [this Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline).

### Goal 5: Zsh syntax highlighting

My final goal on my essential list is to enable syntax highlighting in
the zsh command line editor. For instance, when I type an invalid
command, it would be red, and when I type a correct command, such as
"ls" or "cd", it'd be green.

Here's a screenshot to explain what I meant by zsh syntax highlighting:

![Zsh syntax highlighting](/images/zsh-prompt4.png){: width="80%"}
_Zsh syntax highlighting_

This can save you the hassle of pressing `Enter` and only then finding
out the command you typed had a typo.

To enable this cool little feature, we need to install [this package,
which is conveniently named
zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting). Follow
[the official
guide](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
to install the package for your operating system, and add a line or
two to enable the feature in your `.zshrc`.

Since I'm using Arch, I would first install zsh-syntax-highlighting
using the `pacman` package manager (`pacman -Syu ; pacman -S
zsh-syntax-highlighting`), then add the following line to the bottom
of my zsh configuration file:

```sh
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

Note that the exact directory to "source" depends on where you
installed the syntax-highlighting package. "Sourcing" is nothing
complicated, it's simply taking the file you want to source and
dumping it in your `.zshrc`.

## Concluding words

If you were an oh-my-zsh user and followed everything in this article,
congratulations! Your shell should feel more snappy and responsive,
especially when launching a new instance. If you are a proud oh-my-zsh
user who has brilliantly fast hardware or doesn't care about the extra
second of load time &mdash; that's fine, too!

That's all for today, cheers.
