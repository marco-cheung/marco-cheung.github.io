[Boss Bottled](https://www.hugoboss.com/fragrances-men-boss-bottled/)
is my first serious fragrance, which I bought after a summer job in
California a couple of years back. The perfumers are Annick Menardo
and Christian Dussoulier. Officially, the notes of this fragrance
include:

- **Top Notes**: Apple
- **Heart Notes**: Geranium, Cinnamon
- **Base Notes**: Sensual Woody Notes

For me, it's a subtly delicious pleasant warm sweet mix that's also
not a sugar overdrive. The opening consists of mainly cinnamon, green
apple, and vanilla flavors (though this last one isn't officially
listed). After an hour or two, the vanilla lingers with a hint of
nature's woody notes, and the cinnamon gradually fades away. Just like
how [its commercial featuring Chris
Hemsworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4hZKm0fCuM) portrayed it,
the scent gives me a strong "professional and successful" vibe. I'd
imagine one wearing it along with a crisp white Oxford shirt and a
navy suit. It's a fragrance that I wouldn't be too surprised if I
smelled it on Christian Grey (from "50 Shades of Grey") or Harvey
Specter (from "Suits").

The bottle representation, like its scent, isn't too extravagant
either. The designers went with a classic wine-bottle-ish shape. The
subtle lemonade yellow liquid that shines through the perfectly
transparent glass rounds up the simplicity and boldness of Boss
Bottled.

In terms of its uniqueness, I'd say Boss Bottled is fairly
distinctive. You shouldn't worry about smelling similar to every other
random guy down the street. If I were to choose one "signature scent"
for myself, I'd go with this one. Every time I put on Boss Bottled,
I'm immediately overwhelmed by positivity and confidence. The only
downside is that it smells a bit too formal and elegant for everyday
wear, and its longevity performance isn't the best. My preferred
seasons of wearing this fragrance is spring and fall.

That's it for my review on Boss Bottled, thanks for reading.
