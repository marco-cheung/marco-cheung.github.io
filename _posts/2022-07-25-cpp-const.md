## Understanding `const` in C++

Every C++ programmer must've at one point struggled with the subtle
differences between the following declarations:

```cpp
const T num;
T const num;
T *ptr;
T const *ptr;
T *const ptr;
T const *const ptr;
const T *const ptr;
```

In the example above, `T` is just a type placeholder that can be
replaced with `int`, `std::string`, an STL container, or any custom
class you like.

To understand the declarations in the example, we need only understand
the one rule of C++'s `const` qualifier: **"`const` applies to what's
immediately on the left. If there's nothing on the left, apply to its
immediate right."**

Let's break this down further.

- If the `const` qualifier is applying to some `T` (a type, like
  `int`, or `std::unordered_map<int, int>`), it is making the `T`
  constant. This means the `T` is immutable, despite the pointer
  pointing to it (if there is one) being potentially mutable.

- If the `const` qualifier is applying to `*`, it's making the pointer
  itself constant. This means the pointer cannot change the address it
  points to, yet the value at that address is potentially mutable.

With this in mind, it shouldn't be hard to decode the declarations
above:

```cpp
const T obj;         // obj is a constant T
T const obj;         // obj is a constant T
T *ptr;              // ptr is a mutable pointer to a mutable T
T const *ptr;        // ptr is a mutable pointer to a constant T
T *const ptr;        // ptr is a constant pointer to a mutable T
T const *const ptr;  // ptr is a constant pointer to a constant T
const T *const ptr;  // ptr is a constant pointer to a constant T
```

### What about references (`&`)?

For references, there is less ambiguity, because we cannot apply the
`const` qualifier to the "reference" itself anyways:

```cpp
const T &obj = 0;  // obj is a reference to a constant T
T const &obj = 0;  // obj is a reference to a constant T
T &const obj = 0;  // ERROR: Invalid Reference Qualifier Application
```

## East const or West const?

Like tabs vs. spaces and the editor wars (Vi vs. Emacs), East const
vs. West const has been a long rivalry in the programmer community (at
least for C++ developers), with West const being the conventional
standard and East const being the modern revolution bringing arguments such
as "more consistent and logical". To demonstrate the
differences, consider the following example:

```cpp
const int num = 0;  // West const
int const num = 0;  // East const

const T *const ptr;  // West const
T const *const ptr;  // East const
```

Personally, I prefer to use West const because I think it reads more
intuitive (`const int` declares a "constant integer"), is more popular
in existing code bases, and is the recommended style in C++ Core
Guidelines. Additionally, 

- `const T &` is the style used in Bjarne Stroustrup's The C++ Programming Language book.
- `const T &` is the style used in the C++ standard itself.
- `const T *` is the style used in K&R's The C Programming Language book.
- `const T *` is the style used in the C standard.

However, East const does have the advantage of being super consistent,
always applying `const` to its immediate left with no exceptions
(I.e. there will always be something on the left to apply to, because
`const int num` would be written as `int const num` in East const
style, for instance.). To read about more arguments for East const, consider [this
well-written blog
post](https://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2018/11/23/join-the-east-const-revolution/)
by an East const advocate.

As in all programming style-related debates, just pick one and be
consistent with it throughout a project. It also helps to understand
different styles so we never get confused regardless of the code base.

That's all I have this time, thanks for stopping by.
